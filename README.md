Odin Project No.1
=================

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

----------

For this mini-project, I will deconstruct an existing web page and rebuild it from scratch.

----------

This project has helped me gain a better understanding of html structures including the use of flex-box and practise my basic css styling. I have also used this opportunity to use Git and Github to expand my experience of using version control.
